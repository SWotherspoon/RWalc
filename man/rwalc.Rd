\description{
Fit a continuous time correlated random walk to filter a track and
predict locations for given time steps.
}
\details{
The filter fits a continuous time correlated random walk movement
model similar to that described in Johnson et al. (2008) and
implemented in the package \pkg{crawl}.  Unlike the crawl model,
the model implemented here has no drift or haul out components,
and assumes t distributed errors as described by Albertsen et
al. (2015) if \code{tdf} is positive.

The input track may consist of several independent segments.
These may represent either non-overlapping segments of a single
track, or distinct tracks that may overlap in time.  The fitted
random walk is correlated within a segment, but segments are
assumed independent. It is assumed the input dataframe is ordered
by segment and by date within segment.

The input track to be filtered is supplied as a dataframe
(\code{data}) where each row is an observed location, with columns
\tabular{ll}{
segment \tab track segment (integer, optional) \cr
date \tab observation time (as GMT POSIXct) \cr
x \tab observed x coordinate \cr
y \tab observed y coordinate \cr
x.se \tab standard error of the x coordinate (optional) \cr
y.se \tab standard error of the y coordinate (optional) \cr
}
The filtering model assumes the errors in the spatial coordinates
are have standard deviations 'x.se' and 'y.se' scaled by the
\eqn{\tau}{tau} model parameters. If these columns are missing,
they are assumed to be 1.

An estimate of the track is required to initialize the fitting
process.  This can be supplied by the user through the
\code{track} argument as a dataframe with the same format returned
by \code{\link{interpolateTrack}}.  When this argument is
\code{NULL}, the initial track is generated with
\code{interpolateTrack} from the \code{data} and \code{predict}
arguments.

The \code{predict} argument specifies prediction times for which
locations along the track will be predicted when no initial track
is given.  When the track consists of a single segment, these
argument may be a vector of POSIXct times, otherwise it must be a
dataframe with columns
\tabular{ll}{
segment \tab track segment (integer, optional) \cr
date \tab prediction time (as GMT POSIXct)
}
If an initial track is given, the prediction times are determined
from that.

The arguments \code{betaPar}, \code{sigmaPar} and \code{tauPar}
control how the correlation parameters \eqn{\beta}{beta}, the
standard deviations of the innovations for the velocity process
\eqn{\sigma}{sigma} and the error scaling parameters
\eqn{\tau}{tau} apply to the x and y processes:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{"free"} \tab independent parameters are estimated for
    x and y \cr
\code{"equal"} \tab a common parameter is estimated for both
    x and y \cr
\code{"fixed"} \tab the parameters are determined by \code{par}
}
